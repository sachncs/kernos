### Changed

- Rebranded package from aware-kernel to kernos
- Renamed public estimator `AwareKernelEstimator` to `Kernos`
- Renamed hyperparameters to match the new `Plan` schema (`dim`, `mbasis`, `abasis`, `ridge`, `mode`, `steps`, …)
- Replaced `AblationConfig` dataclass with `Plan` boolean ablation flags (`noref`, `nohyst`, `nocool`, `noresid`, `noorth`, `nodiv`, `nofreeze`)
- Renamed baseline classes (`NystromRidgeBaseline` → `Nystrom`, `RandomFeatureBaseline` → `Random`) under `kernos.bench.baseline`
- Renamed metrics helper `compute_all_metrics` → `allmetrics` under `kernos.bench.metric`
- Renamed `MemoryMode` enum to `Buffer` under `kernos.core.plan`
- Replaced `TrainingLoop` with `Loop` under `kernos.loop.loop`
- Updated all documentation, GitHub metadata, and examples to use the new API
- Converted semi-private naming conventions to public API (removed `_` prefix from attributes with property accessors)
- Replaced `print` statements with `logging` module in training callbacks
- Updated tests to reflect public attribute naming
- Updated README.md with badges, detailed sections, and improved examples
- Updated pyproject.toml with correct repository URLs, classifiers, and metadata
- Updated .gitignore with additional Python-specific patterns
